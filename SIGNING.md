# Signing Policy

This document describes the policy for signing releases of the jewl.app project. jewl.app uses a 2-of-3 multisig policy for signing releases, meaning that two out of three of signing parties must sign a release in order for it to be deployed to the mainnet. Though less crucial to the safety of the protocol but not unimportant, this signing policy also applies to deployments of the jewl.app CLI and web app and is enforced through reviews on Github Pull Requests.

## Signing Parties

The main signers shall be a representatives of the jewl.app organisation and a representative of FINANCE ORG. The finial signer shall be notable party in the crypto space that is not involved in the development or financing of the project, nor shall the neutral party hold any jewl.app tokens to remain impartial.

The neutral party's main purpose is to prevent colluding and ensure the safety of funds stored in jewl.app. The neutral party shall act as a tie breaker in the event of a dispute and is there to ensure that the protocol can continue in case one of the other parties becomes compromised. The third party shall always act in the interest of the protocol and its users.

Below is a list of the individuals that are currently in charge of signing jewl.app releases. The signing parties shall always be listed here by full name, job description and social handle. This list might change at any time and will be updated here as needed. Any of the three orgisations may appoint a new individual at any time at their sole descression.

* [](), Lead Engineer, jewl.app
* [](), Financer, FINANCE ORG
* [](), Crypto advocate, NOTABLE PARTY

## Signer Protocol

For the safety of the protocol below are a few guildlines that all signing parties shall follow.

* Signing parties shall never have access to the same computer, internet connection, phone number or email and shall never physically meet or be within a 100km radius of one another.
* Signing parties shall use a PIN-protected hardware wallet to sign transactions that shall always be caried by the sining party and the signing party alone.
* Backup keyphrase shall be stored in a secure location that only the signing party has access to, such as a safety deposit box.
* Signing parties shall never share their PIN code or keyphrase with anyone.

## Signing Policy

* A protocol upgrade may be initiated by any of the signing parties.
* A protocol upgrade requires one other signature (apart from the initiator) to be deployed to the mainnet.

## Compromised Parties

In the event one of the signing parties above is compromised, the following steps should be taken immediately to ensure the safety of the protocol:
* The other two parties shall immediately be notified of the compromise.
* The other two parties shall immediately revoke the compromised party's from the multisig.
* The other two parties shall decide on an appropriate course of action to maintain the continuity and security of the potocol.

A compromise is defined as any of the following (non-exhaustive):
* Physical threat to the signing party or an invididual close to the singing party such as kidnapping, blackmail or randsom.
* Compromise of the signing party's hardware wallet, PIN or keyphrase by means of theft, imporper use, social engineering or phishing.
* A signing party going rogue and acting against the interest of the protocol (as evaluated by the other two parties).
* A signing party being unable to perform their duties due to illness or other reasons.
* A signing party going dark and not responding to any attempts to contact them.

*jewl.app reserves the right to amend these provisions at its sole discression. Any amendment takes effect immediately. jewl.app users are advised to regulary check this page.*
