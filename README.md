# jewl.app

*A set of smart contracts and tools for creating on-chain representations of securities and equities on the Solana Chain. By leveraging Solana's high throughput and low transaction fees, this project aims to make it easier and more efficient for companies and investors to manage and trade securities.*

## Getting Started

* Install NodeJS using `brew install node`.
* Install the Rust language using `curl -sSfL https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`.
* Install the Solana SDK using `curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/edge/install | sh`.
* Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/jewl-app/.github`.
* Set up a Solana wallet if you don't have one already (see below).

### Setting up a Solana wallet

* Create a new keypair  using `solana-keygen new`.
* Check if you have a valid wallet address using `solana address`.
* Set your local config to use the Solana devnet using `solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com`.
* Give yourself 1 SOL (for transaction fees) using `solana airdrop 1`.
* Check if you have a positive balance using `solana balance`.

## Components

This repository consists of the a couple of different components that can be run independently of each other. The following is a list of the components and their purpose.

### Solana Program

This part of the repository contains the [Solana](https://solana.com) program for jewl.app. There are various accounts that play a part in jewl.app's program. The following is a list of the accounts and their purpose.

* **jewl program**: This is the program account that holds all the logic related to jewl.app. This account allows users of jewl.app to exchange tokenzied securities and equities for SOL minus a small fee.
* **jewl state**: The jewl account owns a single data account which stores the addresses of all the tokens that are supported by jewl.app.
* **token mints**: The jewl account owns an SPL token mint account for each token that is supported by jewl.app. These token mints are used to mint tokens that are being exchanged for SOL.
* **token accounts**: The jewl account owns an SPL token account for each token that is supported by jewl.app. These token accounts are used to hold the tokens reserves that can be exchanged for SOL.

You can build the program using the `npm run sol:build` command. You can deploy the program using the `npm run sol:deploy` command.

### Command Line Interface

This repository contains a CLI for convenience. The CLI can be used deploy the programs and to interact with the deployed programs. The cli can be called through the `npm run cli:start` command.

### Web App

This part of the repository contains the [React](https://reactjs.org) static site for jewl.app. The web app can be started using the `npm run web:start` command. A production version can be built using the `npm run web:build` command.

### Miscellaneous

There are a couple other commands related to running checks and tests. The following is a list of the commands and their purpose.

* `npm run test` - run the unit test suite.
* `npm run lint` - run the [ESLint](https://eslint.org) linter and prettier.
* `npm run clean` - cleanup any built artifacts and caches.
