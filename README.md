# jewl.app

*A set of smart contracts and tools for creating on-chain representations of securities and equities on the Solana Chain. By leveraging Solana's high throughput and low transaction fees, this project aims to make it easier and more efficient for companies and investors to manage and trade securities.*

This repository consists of the a couple of different components that can be run independently of each other. The following is a list of the components and their purpose.

## Solana Smart Contract

This part of the repository contains the [Solana](https://solana.com) smart contract for jewl.app. There are various accounts that play a part in jewl.app's smart contract. The following is a list of the accounts and their purpose.

* **jewl program**: This is the program account that holds all the logic related to jewl.app. This account allows users of jewl.app to exchange tokenzied securities and equities for SOL minus a small fee.
* **jewl state**: The jewl account owns a single data account which stores the addresses of all the tokens that are supported by jewl.app.
* **token mints**: The jewl account owns an SPL token mint account for each token that is supported by jewl.app. These token mints are used to mint tokens that are being exchanged for SOL.
* **token accounts**: The jewl account owns an SPL token account for each token that is supported by jewl.app. These token accounts are used to hold the tokens reserves that can be exchanged for SOL.
