# Frequently Asked Questions

<details><summary>How long does it take for my order to complete?</summary><p>jewl.app bundles similar orders together giving you a better price with lower fees for your purchase. Orders should be executed within a few hours of their scheduled exucution time. If you think something is wrong feel free to send us a message and we'll be happy to help!</p></details>

<details><summary>Why do I need a non-custodial wallet?</summary><p>Custodial wallets might be convenient and you won't need to pay transfer fees, you are trusting someone else with complete control of your assets. With a non-custodial wallet you are in full control. Take a look at what happened to FTX or QuadrigaCX for an example of the risks. Not your keys, not your coins.</p></details>

<details><summary>What is the best crypto wallet?</summary><p>While we don't think there is a single best wallet out there. We do think that you should invest in a quality hardware wallet if you are serious about crypto investing. A hardware wallet keeps your private keys, and thus your assets, safe on a secure physical device that is disconected from the internet.</p></details>

<details><summary>What cryptocurrency should I buy?</summary><p>While we cannot give you a definitive answer to that question, it is a good idea to diversify your portfolio across different blockchains.</p></details>

<details><summary>I accidentally sent my cryptocurrency to the wrong wallet. What can I do?</summary><p>All crypto transactions are final. If you have access to the wallet that you can simply transfer the tokens to a wallet of your choice. If you do not have access to the wallet your funds are unfortunately lost forever. Please always triple check when entering wallet addresses for receing crypto assets.</p></details>

<details><summary>What are transaction fees and why am I paying them?</summary><p>To transfer crypto assets from one wallet to another we need to pay a small fee to make sure our transaction gets validated and included in the blockchain ledger. These fees can be compared to payment fees charged in traditional finance. Because jewl.app transfers the crypto assets directly into your own wallet, transfer fees will need to be payed for the transfer.</p></details>

<details><summary>Some of my orders seem to be fulfilled by Coinbase. Why is that?</summary><p>jewl.app buys and sells cryptocurrencies through Coinbase to get you the best price for you. We sometimes transfer assets directly from our Coinbase account to your wallet. If you were wondering, we only keep a small active balance on our Coinbase account. All our longer-term holds are safely stored on a hardware wallet.</p></details>
