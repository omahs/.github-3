## Securities Tokenization on the Solana Network

jewl.app is a decentralized platform for trading tokenized financial assets on the Solana network. Our solution consists of a Solana program that can fully automatically issue tokenized representations of traditional financial assets such as stocks and ETFs. These tokens are fully backed by the underlying assets, and our exchange mechanism will ensure that the trading price of the tokens closely follows the trading price of the underlying assets, while providing users with full custody of their assets.

Here you can find the open-source codebase for jewl.app, which includes the Solana program, the web interface, and some other useful tools. The Solana program is implemented in Rust and consists of several smart contracts that power the core functionalities of the jewl.app protocol, such as token minting, swapping, and liquidity provision. The web interface is built using modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Web3.js and allows users to interact with the protocol seamlessly. Additionally, the codebase includes several useful tools, such as a CLI for interacting with the protocol, a test suite, and a deployment script that automates the process of deployments.

We welcome [contributions](https://github.com/jewl-app/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) from the community and encourage developers to explore our codebase, create new features, and build on top of our platform. Our goal is to provide users with a unique and innovative way to invest and trade financial assets, while also increasing the usage of the Solana network and attracting new users to the ecosystem.

Whether you're a financial institution looking to tokenize your assets, an investor looking for new opportunities, or a developer interested in building on Solana, jewl.app provides a powerful set of tools for creating and managing on-chain securities.
